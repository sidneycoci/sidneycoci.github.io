                        <p> The aim of this project was to creata a virtual reality simulation to be used in a psychological study. 
                            For privacy reasons, the details regarding this study must be non-disclosed. This program was created for the 
                            Omnicept HP Reverb G2 headset, which takes real-time data of the user's biometrics as they participate in the
                            simulation. The simulation was designed for participants to experience walking across a bridge over a canyon, 
                            with a view accessible only to the experimenter that showcases the user's biometrics as they cross the bridge.

                        <p> I was the sole UX/UI Designer on this project, and was responsible for designing the entire user interface for the 
                            program. The main interface of this project was for the experimenter's view, which was a 2D screen that showcased a variety
                            of biometric data updating in real-time, as well as allowing the experimenter to control the simulation. I worked with the
                            primary investigator to ideate what these necessary functions would be, and then implemented in the dashboard seamlessly with the real-time biometrics, 
                            which I also designed.

                        <p>This project was created in Unity, with the 2D assets designed using Figma, Adobe Indesign and Adobe Photoshop.</p>

                        <p class="spec-head">KEY TAKEAWAYS:</p>
                        <p> This project was a unique experience for me, as I had never worked on a project that required real-time data to be displayed
                            in a 2D interface. I learned a lot about the importance of designing for real-time data, and how to make sure that the user
                            can easily understand what they are seeing. As well as this, having to view the design from the perspective of someone
                            who was not the "primary" user, but instead an observer of the primary target was a new challenge for me. I had to view the 
                            design from a research lens, which influenced many of the design decisions I made.
