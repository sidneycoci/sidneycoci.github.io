                        <p class="spec-head">BRIEF:</p>
                        <p>The aim of this project was to create a simulation where the user could swim in an underwater landscape and interact with
                            marine life while hearing music that was specifically composed for each marine species. This program is to be used in a 
                            study analyzing whether or not hearing specific music compositions increases the user's comprehensive ability when it comes to
                            remembering details about marine species.

                        <p class="spec-head">MY ROLE:</p>
                        <p>I was put on this project as the sole UX/UI designer. My responsibilities included meeting with the Principal Investigator
                            and his team, consisting of various marine science and music majors, to understand the necessary functions a user would need
                            to be able to complete in this simulation. Using this information, I created a user-flow chart, wireframes, and final 
                            designs for the developer to implement. 
                        </p>

                        <p>This project was created in Unity, with the 2D assets designed using Figma, Adobe Indesign and Adobe Photoshop.</p>

                        <p> This project was one of the first design sprints I was on. It was a great experience learning how to design under an accelerated time frame
                            and also gave me the opportunity to work with a variety of different disciplines. I really enjoyed the intersection of marine science and music
                            and felt that it presented a fun design challenge for me to solve. This project is now fully in its developmental phase, and I am excited to see the final outcome!
