                        <p class="spec-head">BRIEF:</p>
                        <p> The aim of this project was to create a virtual reality simulation to be used in a psychological study testing 
                            if virtual reality programs were a viable alternative to treat irrational fears in children with autism. The program
                            addresses two main stimuli that are typically feared by children with autism: dogs and spiders. The program was designed
                            with two user-fronts: one is the virtual reality experience, where the user is placed in a simulated room with a dog or spider.
                            The second interface is for the experimenter, who is able to control the simulation and view the user's biometric data.

                        <p class="spec-head">MY ROLE:</p>
                        <p> I was the sole UX/UI Designer on this project, and was responsible for designing the entire user interface for the 
                            program. The main user interface for this program was the experimenter's view, which was a 2D overlay that showed the 
                            experimenter the user's heart rate, pupil dilation, eye direction, a feed of their mouth camera, and provided the experimenter a way to take notes and input SUDS (Subjective Units of Distress) ratings. As well as this, the 
                            interface also gave the experimenter the ability to spawn in stimuli at different stimulus levels. They can spawn in a small dog,
                            medium dog, large dog, or spider. They can also alter specific settings, such as the movement speed and bounds of the stimuli, and 
                            can choose to place the dog in a cage or spider in a jar, for the user to interact with. I worked with the primary investigator to 
                            understand the necessary functions a user and experimenter would need to complete, and using these agreed-upon user flows I 
                            incorporated them into the design. I also designed the start screens, where the experimenter sets up all necessary data.

                        <p>This project was created in Unity, with the 2D assets designed using Figma, Adobe Indesign and Adobe Photoshop.</p>

                        <p> This project was my first project working with the VESL, and it allowed me to learn a lot about what it means to be 
                            in the role of a UX Designer. I learned how to work with a client to understand their needs, and how to translate those needs
                            into functional, intuitive interfaces. As well as this, I also learned the value of communication. Working with another
                            student developer gave me invaluable communication skills, as at many points we were working together to ensure that the front-end
                            aligned with what they were constructing on the backend of the program, and vice-versa: that what they were creating on the backend
                            aligned with what the client's user experience needs were. The developer and I were able to present this project at the University of Miami's
                            inagural day of computing, where we were able to demo with 15+ users and receive feedback. At the end of the day, we were voted to receive
                            the People's Choice Demo award, which was an incredible experience.

                <p>*** Please note: the computer we demo'd the project on in this video is not the computer being used in the experiment, hence the off-proportions and alignment.
                    This project did not have to be scaleable because it is only meant to be administered on a specific device, but should the experimentation prove that this is a viable
                    treatment option, we would produce a scaleable version.
