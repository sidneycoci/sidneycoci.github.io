                        <p> The aim of this project was to create a mobile app to help people treat common symptoms and illnesses with ancient-medicinal
                            holistic practices. The app was designed to take in your symptoms and provide diet and exercise based on holistic medicine practices, 
                            such as specific yoga poses or breathing exercises.

                        <p class="spec-head">MY ROLE:</p>
                        <p> My role in this project was as a graphic designer. I was responsible for creating the app's logo and designing the figures for one of the 
                            key breathing exercises called Pranayama.

                        <p>The assets I created were made using Adobe Illustrator.</p>

                        <p class="spec-head">KEY TAKEAWAYS:</p>
                        <p> This was my first ever freelance project, and a real testing of my graphic design abilities. Switching from a UX/UI design role to a graphic design role was a challenge, but I was able to create a logo and figures that the client was very happy with.
                            It also gave me the chance to further expand on my Adobe Illustrator skills by creating more intricate graphics than I would typically need for my UX/UI projects.
